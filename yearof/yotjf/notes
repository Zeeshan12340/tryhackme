tried ftp bruteforce with "robyn", doesn't work

Nothing on ssh(22,22222), don't think bruteforcing is the way for login

standard port 80,443 has a website with basic functionality, no user input taken or login forms found, interesting images directory found.
page uses picocms, tried a few cves need to look more.

port 8000 has another server which requires an "id" to give some functionality,not much here.

port 8096:- tried a poc for jellyfin SSRF but doesn't work. only two cves found and both relatively low impact
