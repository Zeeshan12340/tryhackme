# TryHackMe

Almost all of my stuff that involves tryhackme. These are not meant to be writeups/walkthroughs and are not structured that way,
but general notes that I took when I was doing rooms for my own reference. Most have a README in them which shows what I tried,
before giving up and checking a writeup.

There is a `project` folder which has a script I made for checking unfinished rooms. There are some koth notes although very basic.
For networks, only wreath and holo are done somewhat properly.

There are no flags but near complete solutions for many challenges.
