# unquotedPoC
This is Visual C# code that will create a new user named "mcfatty" when run as a service.

The installer portion turned out to be unnecessary.

The payload is in SimpleService.Designer.cs. This is propbably the "wrong" area, but it compiles and bypasses AV, so I don't really care :-D

Happy hacking!
