22,80, website has default CMS installation, nothing too interesting other than possible users(from images)
subdomain has chat.rocket.thm which has a login form, register form tells that `admin@rocket.thm` exists so bruteforcing,
bruteforcing is harder as pass is hashed and data is sent to an api in json, and rate-limiting is in place :/

registering as a new user shows users `admin`,`laurent`,`terrance`, rc_uid for admin `CTxGjyP7vzN9B3FCZ`
