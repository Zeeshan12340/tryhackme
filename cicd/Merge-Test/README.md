# Merge Test

Hi all, I'm getting tired of having to test your code before accepting merge requests. Therefore, I have enabled CI/CD on merge request. Only merge requests where the pipeline succeeds will be considered for merging!

This is a testing repo to ensure that Nostromo is working as expected. New Nostromo test cases can be added here.
