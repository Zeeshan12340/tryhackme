The lab lives in the 172.23.0.0/24 range
    172.23.0.3 - This is your primary target, an edge node in the Hadoop network.
    172.23.0.4 - In Hadoop terms, this is called the "master" node. Your final flag is here and root access signifies 
    full Hadoop compromise.
    172.23.0.2 - This is the simulated Kerberos server. This server is out of scope for this challenge.
