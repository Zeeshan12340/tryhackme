Parameter as in "script.sh user" is taken with $1 for first and $2 and so on


How can we get the number of arguments supplied to a script?

$#

 we get the filename of our current script(aka our first argument)? 
$0

transport=('car' 'train' 'bike' 'bus')
echo "${transport[@]}"

use unset to remove a value from array and arr[i]='newvalue'

flags are -f to check for file exist, -w for writable file and so on
